### Make sure Python is installed:
- Open a terminal / command prompt and run:
```
python --version
```

- If you see a version number (e.g., Python 3.11.2), you’re good. If not, install Python for your system.

### Get the game files:
- Download from Github
    - On the repository page, click __Code → Download ZIP__.
    - Extract the ZIP to a directory of your choice.
- Or clone with Git (if you have Git installed)
```
git clone https://github.com/phillsikes/alienPy.git
```

### Run the game:
- Change directory to the directory containing the aliens.py file
- Execute the file
```
python aliens.py
```
- On some systems you might need to specify python3
```
python3 aliens.py
```
The game should launch in the terminal/ command prompt and you can start playing.
